This SQL query and its output represent Product-Level Performance Analysis using Window Functions.
It's an advanced form of trend and variance detection that helps you answer:

🧠 “Which products are performing above or below average?”
🔁 “How is each product performing this year vs. last year?”
🔍 Breakdown of What This SQL Is Doing:

1. AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) → avg_sales
Calculates the average sales for each product across all years.

2. Difference from Average

current_sales - AVG(current_sales) OVER (...) AS diff_avg
Shows how current year sales compare to product's historical average.

Then categorizes the difference:

CASE
  WHEN diff_avg > 0 THEN 'Above Avg'
  WHEN diff_avg < 0 THEN 'Below Avg'
  ELSE 'Avg'
END AS avg_change

3. Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison with LAG()

LAG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year)
Retrieves last year’s sales (py_sales) for the same product.

Calculates:

YoY difference: diff_py

Change Label: Increase / Decrease / No Change

📊 Why This Analysis Is Important
✅ For Product Managers, Sales, or Executives:
Insight Type	          Business Benefit
🔺 Above/Below Avg	    Quickly flags over- and under-performers relative to their norm
🔁 YoY Comparison	      Understand growth/decline patterns over time
🚨 Early Warning	      Spot deteriorating products before they fail
💰 Prioritization	      Invest in high-growth or consistently top-performing SKUs

🧠 Example Interpretations from Output:
Product Name	          Year	Sales	avg_change	py_change
All-Purpose Bike Stand	2012	159  	Below Avg	  No Change
All-Purpose Bike Stand	2013	37683	Above Avg	🔺 Increase
All-Purpose Bike Stand	2014	50421	Above Avg	🔻 Decrease

📌 Conclusion: Although 2014 sales are still above average, they declined from 2013, 
suggesting a potential downward trend worth monitoring.

Interview-Worthy Takeaway
If asked:

"Why would you use window functions in product sales analysis?"

"Window functions let me compare each product's performance to its own history and the broader product catalog. 
By analyzing differences from average and year-over-year trends,
I can detect growth, decline, and consistency patterns, helping the business allocate marketing, inventory, and 
pricing strategies more effectively."

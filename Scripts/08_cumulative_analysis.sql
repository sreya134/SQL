Cumulative Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To calculate running totals or moving averages for key metrics.
    - To track performance over time cumulatively.
    - Useful for growth analysis or identifying long-term trends.

SQL Functions Used:

Calculate:

Total yearly sales (total_sales)

Running total of sales over years (running_total_sales)

Moving average of product price across years (moving_average_price)

Why Cumulative / Running Totals Matter
‚û§ Definition:
A running total (also called cumulative total) is the progressive sum of a measure over time.

‚û§ Use Cases in Business:
Use Case				Business Value
Tracking sales toward annual targets	Shows how far you've come vs goal
Visualizing revenue accumulation	Useful in charts: ‚ÄúYear to Date‚Äù progress
Comparing performance over time		See acceleration, flattening, or declines

üîç How to Interpret This Output
Year (order_date)	total_sales	running_total_sales	moving_average_price
2010	43,419		43,419		3101
2011	7,057,088	7,118,507	3146
2012	5,042,321	12,160,828	2670
2013	16,344,889	28,505,717	2080
2014	45642		29,351,258	1668

Insights You Can Draw:
Sales are increasing year-over-year, especially in 2013 (huge jump).

Running total keeps climbing ‚Äî expected in cumulative views.

Average price is decreasing each year ‚Äî maybe due to discounts, new cheaper products, or market competition.

🎯 Business Goals from SQL Data Analytics Project  
*Turning Data into Insights for Smarter Decisions*

This project simulates a real-world retail or e-commerce analytics system. Using SQL scripts, fact/dimension modeling, and Power BI, we derive clear business goals to drive performance and decision-making.

## 💰 1. Increase Revenue Across Product Lines  
**Why it matters:**  
Sales growth is often driven by a few top-performing products. Identifying them helps focus marketing, stock, and pricing strategies.

**What we analyzed:**
- Top-selling products and categories
- High vs. mid vs. low performers

**SQL Support:**
- `05_magnitude_analysis.sql`
- `06_ranking_analysis.sql`
- `13_report_products.sql`

---

## 🧍‍♀️ 2. Improve Customer Retention and Loyalty  
**Why it matters:**  
Keeping loyal customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Analyzing behavior and segmentation supports retention strategies.

**What we analyzed:**
- VIP vs. Regular vs. New customers
- Recency, frequency, and spend behavior

**SQL Support:**
- `10_data_segmentation.sql`
- `12_report_customers.sql`

---

## 📦 3. Optimize Product Portfolio  
**Why it matters:**  
Not all products are worth the same. Some should be promoted; others discontinued. Understanding product health enables smarter merchandising.

**What we analyzed:**
- Lifespan and recency of product sales
- Average monthly revenue and pricing

**SQL Support:**
- `13_report_products.sql`

---

## 📈 4. Track Sales Performance Over Time  
**Why it matters:**  
Trends help detect seasonality, growth, or sudden drops. Time-based analysis enables proactive decisions.

**What we analyzed:**
- Monthly trends (MoM, YoY)
- Cumulative revenue over time
- Actual vs. target performance

**SQL Support:**
- `07_change_over_time_analysis.sql`
- `08_cumulative_analysis.sql`
- `09_performance_analysis.sql`

---

## 🧠 5. Understand Customer Segments  
**Why it matters:**  
Different customer types behave differently. Segmentation allows for tailored messaging and optimized product targeting.

**What we analyzed:**
- Demographics (age, country, gender)
- Purchase patterns by segment

**SQL Support:**
- `02_dimensions_exploration.sql`
- `10_data_segmentation.sql`
- `12_report_customers.sql`

---

## 🚚 6. Monitor Operational Health  
**Why it matters:**  
Late deliveries and fulfillment delays harm customer experience. Operational metrics ensure smooth backend processes.

**What we analyzed:**
- Order, shipping, and due dates
- Delivery timelines (can be extended)

**SQL Support:**
- `fact_sales` (date fields: `order_date`, `shipping_date`, `due_date`)

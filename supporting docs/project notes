🔹 00. Initializing the Database (00_init_database.sql)
What is it?
This script sets up the base schema, tables, and sample data for your analytics database. Think of it as laying the foundation for a data warehouse, ensuring your data is structured and ready for analysis.
Why It's Important
You can't perform meaningful analysis without a well-structured database. This step ensures:
Tables are created with correct data types and keys.
Initial data is inserted for testing or analysis.
Referential integrity is maintained between fact and dimension tables.

-- Create a simple dimension table
CREATE TABLE dim_product (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name TEXT,
  category TEXT
);
-- Create a fact table
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
  sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  revenue NUMERIC,
  sale_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES dim_product(product_id)
);
✅ Real-World Value
A well-designed schema mirrors business processes, like prepping ingredients before cooking. It ensures your data is ready for analysis and reporting.

🔹 01. Database Exploration (01_database_exploration.sql)
What is it?
This step involves reviewing all tables in the database to understand their schemas, row counts, null values, and overall structure.
Why It's Important
Before diving into analysis, you need to know what data you're working with. This helps:
Verify table relationships.
Identify missing or unexpected values.
Detect duplicates or key issues.

-- List all tables
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
-- Check row count
SELECT 'fact_sales' AS table_name, COUNT(*) FROM fact_sales
UNION ALL
SELECT 'dim_product', COUNT(*) FROM dim_product;
✅ Real-World Value
This is your "data audit" step. Without it, you're analyzing blindly, which can lead to incorrect assumptions or errors.

🔹 02. Dimensions Exploration (02_dimensions_exploration.sql)
What is it?

Why It's Important
Time is critical in most business analyses. You need to know:
The time span of your data.
Whether it covers all expected periods.
If there are gaps in data collection.

✅ Example
-- Min and Max Dates
SELECT MIN(order_date) AS start_date, MAX(order_date) AS end_date
FROM fact_sales;
-- Check for date gaps
SELECT order_date, COUNT(*)
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date;
✅ Real-World Value
Answers questions like: "Do we have complete data for Q1?" or "Is this trend reliable?"

🔹 04. Measures Exploration (04_measures_exploration.sql)
What is it?

🔹 Core SQL Data Analytics Concepts

1. Fact vs Dimension Tables (Star Schema Basics)
What is a Fact Table?
Stores quantitative data about business processes (e.g., sales, orders).
Each row represents a transaction or event.
Contains foreign keys linking to dimension tables.
Examples:
fact_sales: sales_amount, quantity_sold
fact_orders: order_value, delivery_time

What is a Dimension Table?
Contains descriptive attributes providing context to facts.
Typically static or slow-changing (e.g., customer names, product categories).
Examples:
dim_customer: customer_name, gender, loyalty_status
dim_product: category, brand, price_point

Star Schema Example
dim_date
                       ↑
dim_customer ← fact_sales → dim_product
                       ↑
                   dim_store
2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Extract      Pulling raw data from source systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, flat files).
Transform    Cleaning and reshaping data:
             Handling nulls.
             Filtering by business rules.
             Joining tables.
             Calculating metrics (e.g., profit = revenue - cost).

Load         Inserting cleaned data into a data warehouse (e.g., Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery).

-- Example Transformation Step
SELECT
  customer_id,
  UPPER(country) AS country,
  sales_amount * 0.85 AS converted_sales
FROM raw_sales;

3. Data Types in Analytics

Data Type - Description - Use Case
Integer -          Whole numbers -        Quantity, Count
Float/Decimal -    Decimal numbers -      Revenue, Prices, Margins
String/Text        categorical textNames  Emails, Categories
Date/Time          Timestamps             Order date, Signup date
Boolean            True/False             Returned_order, Is_active

4. Aggregation Functions

🔸 SQL Aggregates
SUM() - Total of values, Total revenue by region
COUNT() - Number of entries, Number of customers per product
AVG() - Mean of values, Average basket size
MAX() - Highest value, Max order value
MIN() - Lowest value, Earliest signup date
✅ Example
SELECT region, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY region;

5. Window Functions
✅ Why?
Calculate running totals, ranks, or comparisons without losing row-level detail.
🔸 Example 1: Running Total
SELECT
  customer_id,
  order_date,
  SUM(sales_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders;
🔸 Example 2: Ranking Customers by Revenue
SELECT
  customer_id,
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(sales_amount) DESC) AS revenue_rank
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY customer_id;

6. Date-Based Analysis

Use Case: Current Month Sales

WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) = …
YOY Comparison
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)
MTD/QTD/YTD Metrics
Use BETWEEN with dynamic dates
Day of Week/Month Trend
TO_CHAR(order_date, 'Day')

✅ Example
-- Sales Trend by Month
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
  SUM(sales_amount)
FROM sales
GROUP BY month;

7. Segmentation
Breaking down data by categorical groups for comparison.
Examples:
Sales by product category.
Average order value by customer tier.
Conversion rate by campaign source.

SELECT
  loyalty_tier,
  AVG(order_value) AS avg_value
FROM customers
JOIN orders USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY loyalty_tier;

8. KPI Definitions & Calculations

Conversion Rate - COUNT(purchases) / COUNT(visits)
Average Order Value - SUM(order_amount) / COUNT(order_id)
Churn Rate - COUNT(lost_customers) / COUNT(starting_customers)
Revenue Growth - (Current - Previous) / Previous
Customer Lifetime Value - avg_order_value * purchase_frequency * retention_period

9. Common Business Questions:

Who are the top 10 customers by spend? - ORDER BY SUM() + LIMIT
Which product has the highest profit margin? - JOIN + MAX()
What are monthly sales trends for last 12 months? - DATE_TRUNC + GROUP BY
Which regions are underperforming this quarter? - Comparison + thresholds
Are repeat customers spending more over time? - Window functions + join

🔹 Why Do We Do Segmentation in Analytics?
What Is Segmentation? = Segmentation divides data into meaningful subgroups based on shared attributes (e.g., demographics, behavior, geography).
Why Is It Important?

Tailor decisions to different groups.
High-spending vs. first-time buyers

📊 Better Targeting
Build precise marketing/sales strategies.
Email campaigns for churn-risk customers

💸 ROI Improvement
Allocate resources to high-profit segments.
Focus on regions with high conversion

🚩 Identify Pain Points
Spot underperforming segments.
Region X has low retention

📈 Strategic Growth
Track metrics over time within segments.
Premium customers grew 20% YoY

✅ Common Segmentation Use Cases
Customers by loyalty tier or lifetime value.
Orders by channel (web vs. in-store).
Products by category or price bucket.
Users by engagement (active vs. inactive).

✅ Example
-- Average Order Value by Customer Tier
SELECT
  loyalty_tier,
  AVG(order_value) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders
JOIN customers USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY loyalty_tier;

🔹 Why Do We Analyze Data at All?
✅ The Core Purpose - To turn raw data into actionable insights that improve business performance.
Business Reasons for Data Analysis:
Objective
What We Analyze
Why It Matters
💡 Decision Support
Sales, costs, churn, traffic
Evidence for smart decisions
📉 Find Inefficiencies = Process delays, waste, returns, Reduce costs, optimize operations
📊 Track KPIs = Revenue, AOV, retention, Monitor progress toward goals
